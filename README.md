# hello-world
#H1 assignment for INFM 109
1. I am **very** new to technology in general and this is very overwhelming to me.
2. I feel ~~lost~~ and like I'm in a foreign land where no one else is speaking English. 
3. I am 31 and *returning* to college for a degree in Business. 
4. Even though I am ==overwhelmed== and a bit anxious, I am also excited to be learning all this new information. 
> I hope I get a good grade. :joy:
